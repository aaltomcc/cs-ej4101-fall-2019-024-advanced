* From the online lectures, I learned many of the DevOps principles that were new to me. Some of the related areas were already familiar to me, for example from Software Engineering course, such as continuos integration and related approaches. I also knew this in practice from Software Process 1 & 2 courses, for example. At the time, however, we did not learn how to use such tools ourselves, such as Travis CI.

* In the theoretical part of the course, I learned many key things about DevOps. For example, how is quality constantly improved and what kind of culture is required, and such issues that are included in the CAMS model.
More specifically, the course material dealt with, for example, system thinking, which implies understanding how quality is formed in an entire system, also down stream, so avoiding partial optimization and enabling good flow at all times. In addition, it is important to understand how the system receives feedback in order to develop operations. This means e.g. identifying the right metrics and continually learning and understanding how improvement utilizes its own stakeholders and the customer, and how success is measured.
It was also interesting to learn about the factors that are part of the experimental culture, such as allocating enough time to make improvements and introducing failures to the system. I also learned some basic things about Kaizen principles. Understanding these and many other elements of the course will help me understand the factors to consider when improving speed and quality and developing DevOps in practice. It is good to understand things from both a top-down and a bottom-up perspective, as well as how things are directly related to each other and what is the context.

* I also learned how to use the HUGO framework and adjust its various features to create web pages, such as defining the content of blog posts and the layout of a publication. I am definitely going to get to know the system more precisely at better times and learn some routine uses.
The hardest part related to course was getting to know the practical details of the assignment, because the practical issues have been a little rusty as my studies focused more on theory. For example, learning different HUGO-Themes, it took me a while to realize how different parts interact with each other. Learning Markdown language was straightforward and basics of GIT was familiar to me in the beginning.
