* I decided to choose this course to learn the basics of DevOps. I have studied the Service Design and Engineering major, and so I have had many of the key software and service engineering courses in the plan, but not really anything, what would include DevOps. In addition, the course seemed to be suitably intensive in relation to my own plan. My emphasis is on service design and engineering -track, but I am also interested to learn from some software engineering core issues to get knowledge about the methods in the field, and to be able to use my knowledge in various positions in the future. In addition, this is an important entity related to software quality management and testing philosophy, as well. I have not actually taken separate courses on testing so far, so this was also one of the reasons I chose the course.
In the past, some courses have had quite a short talk about DevOp, but I am intrigued to know what is included in the whole and what principles are used to improve quality considering DevOps. I have also taken note of some DevOps related jobs earlier. However, I was most interested in figuring DevOps out from a theoretical point of view in order to understand it from the perspective of the overall performance of the organizations.

* As for the methods themselves, I expected to learn about relevant tools in practice and to gain information about the tools in general as well. Later, after starting the course, I also expected to learn practical things through exercises. Many tools are practically familiar to me, such as Git, but Markdown and Travis CI were unfamiliar. In my opinion, the course significantly lowers the learning threshold compared to self-study. I think I could apply some of these, for example, when getting started in my own related projects.

* Finally, I chose the course because the course was relatively short. If it had been longer, for example 3-5 credits, I probably would not have chosen it because my actual curriculum is already pretty full.
